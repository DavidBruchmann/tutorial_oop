Tutorial OOP and MVC
====================

Requirements: PHP 5.2+, smarty (PHP template engine)

Description:
------------
This tutorial includes projects to show MVC pattern (Model, View, Controller) as well as OOP (Object Orientated Programming).  
Most of the logic programm-logic is simple to keep the focus on structure and general aspects of programming.  

Currently "smarty" is used as template engine, while a shift to something more modern might be expectable.
"smarty" regrettable has a small impact on the programm-logic as arrays are used for data instead of Objects.  
Nevertheless a general approach for an object-orientated template engine is partially prepared.
